WHITE PAPER ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FIRMS


We have learned that professional service firms are focused on improving their ability to recruit and retain women and people of color.  They especially want to position these diverse young people as future “rainmakers” to acquire new clients, get more business from existing clients and do great work on behalf of all clients.


The people development of most large professional service firms is uneven at best.  More self-confident young people are more likely to seek out and be mentored by more senior people.  They also will have the benefit of being mentored by retired or active executives they might have met through family or through connections made in their home communities.


The challenge is how to “level the playing field” for women and people of color.  The purpose of this white paper is to describe how a productive mentoring and sponsoring relationship would be created and nurtured through tools we might create.


Defining the desired end state


The goal of every senior partner or officer of a professional services firm is to develop the talent that enables the firm to have long-term success, even after the senior people leave the firm.  From the standpoint of shareholder or member value, any large firm that depends on the “rainmaking” ability of a few senior people will be valued at a fraction of its annual revenues.  


If we use the comparison of a large industrial firm like Danaher, that for-profit, public industrial company has a very multiple of earnings because of its “Danaher business system.”  The “system” is a way of doing business that turns out interchangeable and high-quality leaders.  It relieves shareholders of the anxiety that the departure of the senior leadership will result in a deterioration of the firm.  The “system” is very valuable intellectual property.


Our goal is nothing less than the creation of a “system” of intellectual property that drives the development of all young professional service providers, especially the women and people of color in the organization.  We should not sell this as a “diversity and inclusion” tool, but as a professional development platform, which will be tuned to enable women and people of color to benefit, even when senior leaders are not available to mentor and sponsor them.


How to turn all young professionals into “trusted advisors”


In the book Clients for Life, co-authors Jagdish Sheth and Andrew Sobel distinguish between “experts” and “trusted advisors,” with a goal of turning all professionals into “trusted advisors.” They present a chart in which the “trusted advisor” qualities are arrayed side-by-side against the less desirable qualities of “experts.”


These are the seven qualities of “advisors:”


* They have both depth and breadth of knowledge.
* They have exceptional listening skills.
* They ask great questions.
* They develop both professional and personal trust,
* They attempt to collaborate with clients, as opposed to controlling them.
* They supply insight, as well as expertise.
* They focus on both analyzing and synthesizing.


We need to answer three questions to be a great solutions provider:


* How can the young professional approach and engage with the senior leader?
* How can the senior leader do a better job engaging with the young professionals that are less likely to be comfortable with him or her, especially women and people of color?
* How can the senior leader insure that the young professionals develop the “trusted advisor” skills?


Implicit in all three questions is a 4th:  how can an organization achieve the best matching between particular young professionals and senior leaders?


We want to put a stake in the ground and take a particular position on one often-debated topic: we do not believe that an organization has to have female or minority role models, but it would definitely accelerate the process of producing more female and minority leaders.  Catalyst has talked about two development strategies for women, a dichotomy that would apply as well to minority talent: “(i) blending in; or (ii) sticking together.”  We believe that having a female role model is consistent with a “sticking together” strategy, which has value, but that both women and people of color need to be equally comfortable “blending in” with white male leaders.


Let’s take each of the three situations and do a “deeper dive” on how to turn young professionals into trusted advisors.


Coaching young professionals in initiating contact with senior leaders


The initial contact


Many young professionals mistakenly believe that the initiative for a contact between them and a more senior leader has to come from the senior leader.  There may be organizations in which that is the “unwritten rule.”  However, in other organizations, senior leaders may not know who needs or wants mentorship/sponsorship unless young professionals come forward and request such help.


Helping young professionals connect with senior leaders


We would provide both a matching and a coaching tool.  Our coaching tool is probably more important in this iteration of the platform.  The etiquette of approaching a more senior person is delicate, but there are four ways that I believe would work:


* The young professional can be equipped with a detailed understanding of the senior leader’s accomplishments, beyond what would be in a bio, and can use something in that bio to trigger a conversation.  This is what I would call the building of empathy and trust through a more professionally-oriented approach.  An example of this might be this kind of comment: “I have admired your work in the Smith vs. Jones case, and, in particular, the argument you made in the brief on _____.  How did you come up with that argument, which seemed very non-intuitive?”  


A great question is how senior leaders get useful client feedback, especially when a client has multiple people who give work to the outside service provider, even it is presented through an in-house legal representative.  What is the process and how formal and frequent is it?  A particular question that shows a great deal of sophistication is one usable in a big firm that has large public company clients:  how does the firm address the situation in which a client is in a merger or acquisition situation in which the other firm in the merger or acquisition uses a competitive professional services firm? 


* The young professional can approach the more senior person with an approach based on complimenting the more senior person and requesting an opportunity to learn from him or her.  The approach would be more open-ended and would be a more personally-oriented approach. The comment would be more like this: “I have admired your work and your life.  What are the handful of critical success factors that have made the difference?”  
Another way to get the senior leader to open up more is to ask him or her how to manage the emotional challenges of being in a highly competitive industry or of being in a senior leadership environment in which the firm has to balance short and long term revenue goals.


* The young professional can volunteer to help on a specific project or with a specific organization.  I would call this the value-oriented approach.  I actually used this to build a mentor-mentee relationship with a senior McKinsey partner when I was told I needed to do community service work.  I volunteered to be one of the members of his small volunteer team to work on a rail station parking advocacy project.


These can obviously be used in combination.  What can work very effectively is to contact the senior person at the beginning or end of a very long day, or to invite him or her to a small group gathering.  I gained a great deal of credibility with the Pitney Bowes CEO by inviting him to a department holiday dinner in the headquarters.  The young professional would share the senior leader with others, but he or she would get the first opportunity to talk with the senior leader before anyone else can have a contact.


Coaching young people on how to have the conversation with the senior person.


My advice would be as follows:


Preparation in advance of the meeting


* Be well-prepared and well-briefed on the person with whom you are meeting.  Use Google Alerts to get alerted every time the senior person shows up in an online news story.  Use what you learn as an “ice breaker” in the conversation.  Our platform can provide “Google Alerts” to help with the “ice breakers,” and will provide more detailed information that is particularly useful to a young professional.


Getting intelligence from staff people close to the senior leader


* Ideally, spend some time with his or her assistant or chief of staff and befriend them.  Ask them what they can tell you about the person with whom you are meeting that is not obvious from the bio you have.  Arrive early to get the chance to talk with the assistant.  Even better, come at another time to get acquainted.


* If the assistant offers you a beverage before the senior leader is ready, take the opportunity to talk with the assistant during that process, even if you are following him or her to the place where he or she will secure the beverage.


Tactics when entering the room and shortly before or after sitting down


* When entering the senior leader’s room, young professionals should observe what the senior leader has on display in a prominent place on the wall, on a desk, or in some other place in the work space.  This can be the launch point for a question, since the senior leader presumably places something in a prominent place because it has special meaning to him or her.  Family pictures, memorabilia, diplomas or professional certificates, or awards all mean something to the person who displays them.  Asking the senior leader about them is an “ice breaker.”


* If possible, try to sit in a part of the room at which there is no desk or other obstacle between the senior leader and the young professional.  The desk acts as a barrier to more relaxed conversation.


Topics during the conversation


* Ask questions about the organization’s bigger picture and the company’s history and how the environment and the market had changed from when the senior leaders started.


* Ask about his or her upbringing and formative experiences.  This part of the conversation can be brief, but the more someone knows about my upbringing, the more he or she can establish empathy. 


* Ask about the critical success factors in the firm.  Preface your remarks by saying that every firm might have the same list, but also ask him or her to prioritize.  Ask the senior leader to cite examples to make sure you have the best understanding of what he or she is telling you. 


* Ask the senior leader how he or she addresses the complexity of a client organization in which he or she has multiple stakeholders who do not completely agree with one another is a great ice breaker.  It shows the senior leader that the young professional understands the headaches of client relationships.  Tell the senior leader that you understand that there is a “transactional” client relationship on the surface, but a more fundamental strategic relationship issue that may be well hidden.  Ask the senior leader to delineate what is not obvious.


* Another question, which some senior leaders will respect and others may consider more private, is how the firm goes about the process of allocating rewards among senior partners or leaders and how it manages the complexity of giving partners draws against future revenues that may not be realized.  These kinds of questions show that the young professional has a nuanced understanding of the challenges of all professional services firms.


* Another question that evidences a great deal of sophistication is how the firm addresses conflict of interest issues.


* The young professional can ask the senior person how he or she handles specific clients or his or her techniques for securing new clients.  The senior leader who has a completely clean, orderly desk can be asked how he or she manages to get matters addressed so efficiently.  He or she can also be asked about he or she manages time.  One particular problem of all professional services organizations is how to keep track of billable time.  One “ice breaker” is to ask the senior leader how he or she does it.


* Coach young people not to be defensive about their own upbringing.  Many young women or minority professionals are deeply concerned that they may not have the educational or work pedigree of the person they are meeting. They need to be coached not to be defensive, and to be prepared to talk about what they have learned (e.g, resilience, the value of diversity, teamwork).


* Listen actively and ask follow-up questions.  Act like a “counselor.”


* If the senior person has children, ask if they have an interest in the same kinds of professional services as their father or mother that is in front of you.  Offer to meet with one or more of their children to answer any questions they might have about the profession, since you are closer in age and more objective and independent.  Suggest that any child is more likely to open up to a person closer to them in age.


Be respectful of the amount of time available, and strictly adhere to the senior leader’s time limits.  Ask in advance to make sure you do not overstay the time allotted.


Helping senior leaders connect with female and minority young professionals


Senior leaders probably feel like they are “walking on egg shells” today.  There are two differently, but partially overlapping, ways to have conversations with young professionals who are either women or people of color or both.  In either case, assume that the young professional wants mentoring or performance feedback, and ask them what they would most want to know that the senior leader can tell them.


* Focus on asking them about their background and their career aspirations.  Ask about where they grew up, why they made the choices they made, and what they enjoyed most about either their schooling or their outside activities.  Our tool would give them data to help them ask those questions.  Some young professionals from a more economically-challenged background may be uncomfortable about these kinds of questions, but our coaching tool can help frame the question to avoid discomfort.


* The alternative is to ask them specifically about what events or situations in their life experience made them the person they are today.  The question does not specifically touch upon their gender or minority status, but it invites them to talk more openly about it, if they should choose to do so.


The question that every senior leader should ask after the young professional has been part of the organization for a period of time is this: “What can we do to make your experience better?”


The data on women and minority professionals, as well as managers in non-professional services organizations, shows that they leave for two reasons, other than the specific problem of harassment or an uncomfortable and unpleasant work environment:


* They do not feel sufficiently valued for what they have done or can do for the organization; and/or
* They do not believe there are adequate career opportunities available to them.


Both of these issues should be implicitly and explicitly addressed in any conversation.  Our platform should help senior leaders frame the questions that help them get revealing answers.  If they have left another employer, the senior leader might want to ask why, and to ask for a representative example of what prompted them to start for another opportunity.


How can the senior leader coach the young professional in developing “trusted advisor” skills?


The senior leader should be practicing the skills he or she wants to impart to the young professional.  At certain points in the conversation, he or she should recap the conversation and point out techniques or processes that he or she employed during the conversation.


My two best trusted advisors as Pitney Bowes’ CEO were Gershon Kekst, a crisis communications counselor, and Marty Lipton, a leading corporate attorney.  A more detailed description of a representative conversation with each advisor may prompt a better understanding of how we can coach young professionals, particularly women or people of color, to be trusted advisors.


Kekst


In 1995, Pitney Bowes was preparing to file suit against the US Postal Service, its regulator and business partner, but an organization which, at that time, was led by individuals who saw Pitney Bowes as a competitor for mailer funds.  Investors believed that our close relationship with the Postal Service was a competitive advantage.  The initiation of a lawsuit was going to undercut that story.  We believed that the initiation of the lawsuit was going to be a very difficult communications challenge.


Kekst gave us a different level of advice.  He told us that we should not attempt to describe our relationship with the Postal Service.  He suggested that we offer the following response, if asked about the conflict with the Postal Service:


“We have the technology, the financial resources, the customer loyalty, and the talent to succeed in any stage of relationship with the Postal Service.”


This was transformational advice.  It delivered a message that we were in control of our destiny, and that we were not captives of, or hostages to, the Postal Service.  This was almost like the transition from Gloria Gaynor’s 1974 song Never Can Say Goodbye to her 1979 anthem I Will Survive.


This was not just advice about how to handle a communications inquiry or even a relationship, but how we thought about ourselves.  This statement, if internalized, would be a huge confidence builder.
Lipton


In February, 1996, I met with Marty Lipton and asked him what, as a counselor to over 200 Fortune 500 CEOs, was the secret of their success and his advice to me.  His answer was simple and profound: “Secure your relationships with your Board members.  They elect you and are the only people who can fire you.  More importantly, you should be seeking their advice on any very important issue.”


The more important point Lipton was making for me was that it was critical for me to build a consensus among Board members as to the direction of the company.  He recommended that I meet one-on-one with them every year, and that I try to figure out the “center of gravity” of the Board.


He also suggested that I have a support system on any issue that includes, but is not limited to, the Board.  His broader point was that large organizations exist because they aggregate resources that are not available to smaller organizations.


In both cases, these gentlemen were “trusted advisors” because they were giving advice on three levels:


* Addressing a specific situation
* Advising on how to build organizational capacity
* Advising on how to strengthen my own leadership skills


Coaching young professionals on how to become “trusted advisors” is about teaching them how to give advice on all three levels.


Techniques in a conversation with clients


These are the critical techniques that can be conveyed in the conversation:


* Empathy
* Listening skills
* The ability to ask great questions
* The demonstration of broad and deep knowledge.  
* Insight
* Ability to analyze and synthesize


Collaboration can be described, but, since the conversation is not a real client interaction situation, it is only likely to be demonstrated if the senior leader invites a young professional to come to a client interaction and observe him or her in practice.  


However, if that has already happened, a young professional can be invited to offer his or her feedback to the senior leader on how the young professional observed and understood what was happening in that process.  In fact, the art of inviting the young professional to give feedback to the senior leader about what he or she experienced is an excellent tool for making the person feel valued.


If the young professional has already done high quality work, the senior leader can demonstrate “earned respect” by specifically commenting on the quality of that work, and by asking the young professional how he or she went about doing it.


Meetings outside of the senior leader’s office


Be reluctant to have meetings in private offices after hours or at restaurants or bars late at night, whether you are the senior leader or the young professional employee, if the young professional is a woman.
Suggest either a breakfast, lunch, or cup of coffee, or an early dinner at a quieter restaurant, which should be less expensive than the one that the leader might recommend.


Be very reluctant to drink alcohol, whether you are a man or woman.  If asked why you are not doing so by the senior leader, simply explain that you can work longer hours more productively after a good night’s sleep.  Alcohol makes that more challenging.


If your meeting is at a restaurant, be mindful of not ordered or eating messy foods.  If you spill anything, it becomes a distraction.  Scan the menu for the easiest food to eat with the utensils you have.  Ideally, order foods which give you the opportunity to talk or listen without having to eat at the same time.  


If you can learn in advance about the senior leader’s particular passions for wine, meat, vegetables, desserts, beer, or a particular kind of liquor, do so.  This is the kind of question you can comfortably ask an assistant, and can prepare ice breakers for.


There are other settings, such as cocktail parties, at which you might introduce yourself, but be mindful of how many other people are trying to see the senior leader.  Use a cocktail party introduction to get a contact with his or her scheduler.


Specifically ask him or her how you can make it clearer and more credible to the scheduler that you are a person he or she is willing to see.  Assume that many other people will represent that they have been given a meeting opportunity.  The fact that you ask that question will tell him or her that you understand better the demands on his or her time.  


Although he or she will tell you that others keep his schedule, ask about confirmations and when a meeting is least likely to get in the way of some of his or her known important priorities.  You want to fit into his or her life, not be an additional burden on it.
